            What does Climate change?

        <p class="Head2">Climate Change Impacts:</p>
        <p>
Climate change intensifies extreme weather events, causing more frequent and severe droughts, floods, heatwaves, and storms. It disrupts ecosystems, threatens biodiversity, and poses risks to food and water security, ultimately affecting human health and economic stability.
        </p>
        <p class="Head2">Environmental Consequences:</p>
        <p class="textunder">
            Climate change leads to rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and sea-level rise. It's responsible for habitat loss, ocean acidification, and shifting weather patterns, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, species extinction, and the loss of natural resources.

            <div class="column"><p class="Head3">Environmental Benefits</p>
                <p class="textunder">IoT applications, such as smart grids, waste management, and precision agriculture, have the potential to lower carbon footprints. By providing actionable insights and automating processes, IoT contributes to more sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices, crucial for mitigating climate change.</p>

            <div class="column"><p class="Head3">Rising Temperatures and Heatwaves</p>
                <p class="textunder">Climate change is primarily characterized by rising global temperatures. This temperature increase has far-reaching consequences, as it can lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves. Extreme heat events not only affect human health and well-being but also strain energy systems, increase cooling demands, and can harm agriculture and ecosystems. As temperatures continue to climb, prolonged heatwaves become a growing concern, especially in urban areas where the urban heat island effect can exacerbate these conditions.</p>
